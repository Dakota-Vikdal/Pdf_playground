# Pdf_playground
In this project we want to attach a watermark to every page within a multipage pdf file.

We do so by first having access to a watermark pdf file as well as a multipage pdf file.

Next, we create variables that point to the watermark and multipage file as well as a variable that combines the two and creates a new file.

After that we loop over the multipage file and add the watermark onto each page. This process creates a new file, in this case a file named 'watermarked_files.pdf', that has combined the watermark file and the multipage file.

Thanks for reading! Have a good day.
